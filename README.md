- ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, Iâ€™m @juupelila
- I Work on commercial projects. I have no interest in wasting my time on open source projects except ones I do for my own use.
- Those projects will not be on github or any other external service.
- I am experienced programmer.
- Any employer would have a very hard time hiring me.
